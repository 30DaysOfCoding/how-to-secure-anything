- Detection: regular inmate counts, random cell counts, searches, guard notices inmate climbing wall, etc
- Response: triggering lights, lighting selected area, closing gates, etc
- Assessment: determining the nature, degree of a situation

    - Prevents contraband from coming in
    - Prevents unauthorized people from coming in or leaving
- Internal security zones

    - Maintain separation between key activities, inmate occupied areas, especially inmates who pose the highest risk
