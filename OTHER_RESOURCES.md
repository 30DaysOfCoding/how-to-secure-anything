# Other resources

I didn't include this resources in the README, as they're not part of my
learning path currently, but I may find them useful later on.

- [Engineering Trustworthy Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Trustworthy-Systems-Cybersecurity-Design/dp/1260118177)
- Chapters in Anderson's book, like those on telecom and emission security, which I haven't added here as I don't understand the
domains well enough
- [Reflections on trusting trust](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf)
