# Awesome Security Engineering

Security engineering, to me, is the discipline of building secure systems. 
Ultimately, I hope to learn how to systematically secure anything --
whether it's a computer network or medieval castle.

This documents how I'm going about learning about security engineering. It may
not be the learning path that works best for you.

Also, this is a curated, not comprehensive, list of resources.

## Learn the "levers" at my disposal

These are tools you can use to secure something. 

### Cryptography

- ["Advanced Cryptographic Engineering" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch20-mar17.pdf)

To learn about later: secure enclaves 

### Economics

- ["Economics" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch8-dec18.pdf)

### Tamper resistance

- ["Physical tamper resistance" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch18-dec18.pdf)

### Tamper detection

If we can't prevent tampering, we can try to make it obvious when something has been tampered with.

This one reason why bags of chips or gallons of milk, for example, are sealed.

### Access control

- ["Access control" (from Ross Anderson's book)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch6-dec18.pdf)

### Authorization

### Biometrics

### Sandboxing
