# Awesome Security Engineering

Security engineering, to me, is the discipline of building secure systems. 
Ultimately, I hope to learn how to systematically secure anything --
whether it's a computer network or medieval castle.

This documents how I'm going about learning about security engineering. It may
not be the learning path that works best for you.
